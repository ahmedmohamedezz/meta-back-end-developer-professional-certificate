- How The Internet Works ?
- network is made by at least 2 devices that connect & communicate via a wired or wireless connection .
- you can connect multiple devices to network , but to make all of them connect to each other and communicate it will be very complex very quickly , why ?
	- that's because you need to connect every device to all devices , is there a solution ? YES
	- switches solves this problem by connecting all devices in a network to it , and it will let them connect to each other and communicate .
- networks can be conneted to each other via switches ( switches connect devices & networks too ) .
- multiple switches can be connected together to form an interconnected network like the internet
- when you use a website or any video streaming services , these are provided by computers called "servers" , our devices are called clients .
	- this is called the client-server model
- data travel through large undersee cables connecting the world networks
	- these cables can transfer huge volumes of data per second
- ofcourse there is another more technical details that makes the internet possible , but this is the main idea .

- Web Servers
- server : computer that runs application & services ranging from websites => instant messaging
- servers are called like this because they provide a service to another computer and it's user ( provide services to clients )
- server is stored in something called "data center" with another hundreds or thousands of servers all running different services connected to the internet .
- data centers have many systems to ensure that servers have continuous power and connected to the internet , and kept called 24 hours per day
- data centers are located all around the world ( many websites use this to let you access your content quickly through the nearst data center to you )
- servers are build based on the service purpose .
	- server for storing imgs may consist of a lot of hard drive space , while a server that computes complex calculations might need a fact processor and a lot of memory .
- drives , proccors , and memory are usually refered to "server hardware" => physical components of the server
- after hardware is installed , a piece of code can now run on it called => "server software"
- hardware is something you can touch , and is difficult to change      ,,, while software can't be touched and easy to change
- one type of servers is "web server" = service software
- web servers has many functions like managing emails ,handling security ,it also can function as a website storage and administration , and data storage .
- web servers can handle "web request" => primary function in web servers
	- when you search for a website , it's the role of the web server to send you back that website's content ==> process of "request response cycle"
- web servers have to be able to handle thousands of requests from clients per second

						-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Websites and Webpages 
- web page : document that displays images , text , videos , and another content in the web browser
- web site : collection of web pages connected together
- if several web pages have similar address in the web browser => they belong the same web site
- links on a web page don't have to connect to pages on the same web site ( they can link other web sites )
- web page => simply a text document , that you can edit it using any text editor
- web pages are based on 3 technologies : html , css , and java script
- Html : structure the content you see
	- html stands for "hyper text markup language" , it works using markup tags => these tags describe the content displayed in the browser
	- this content can be ( paragraphs , headings , audio , video , images )
	- the way html describes the content is called "markup"
- Css : controls the colors and the style
	- css is a shorthand for "cascading style sheets" , used to add visual enhancements like colors & layouts ( css is used for styling )
	- css tells html elements how to be displayed
- JavaScript : responsible for user interaction
	- Js is a programming language built into the browser , provides tools to developers for ( interactivity , data processing , control , and action )
	- Js has the ability to manipulate the content you see as you interact with
- how that code is translated into web pages ?
	- when a copy of a web page is sent from the server to the browser , each line of code is processed in sequential order from first to last
	- as each line is interpreted , the browser creates the building blocks => visual representation you see on the screen
	- this creation process is known as "page rendering"
	- the response from the server => complete web page

						-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Web browser
- web browser or "browser" is  a software application you use to browse the world wide web
- how it works ? by sending a request to web server , and recieves a response containing the content that is to be displayed on the screen of your device
- on the top of the web browser you will find the address of the website you're currently using => aka "URL" : uniform resource locator
- URL contains : protocol "http" + domain name "website name" + location "file path or path to the page displayed"
- when making a request using the url , the browser and the server communicate using a protocol called http => "hypertext transfer protocol"
- exchange of information is made by "request response cycle"
- let's simulate what happen with an example :
	1. first you open the browser and type the name of you want to search for ( what you type contains the domain name )
	2. after you press enter , the web browser sends a request across the network to another computer called web server
	3. web server respondes by sending a web page back to the web browser
	4. after recieving all the response info , the web page is made visible
	5. the web page is a coded document that is rendered by the browser
	6. once again you search for something , the web browser sends a request to search engine web server with keywords , or additional instructions
	7. web server processes the request by taking the keyword and using it to find the requested data 
	8. data is stored on ==> "data base" , which is connected to the web server
	9. finally the web server picks up the data , and sends it to the browser to be rendered

- Web hosting
- after you knew that web sites and files are stored on web server , which is located in data centers
- do you need your own data center to create your own website ? NO , but you use something called "web hosting"
- web hosting is a service where you can store your web site and files on the hosting companies web servers
	- you're renting space in return for stable and secure storage ( companies / individuals can rent space )
- hosting options 
1. shared hosing
	- cheapest form of hosting
	- you pay for a location on a web server that is shared with other web hosting accounts
	- this means you also share ( service processing power , memory , and bandwidth ) , which may slow your performance
	- this option is the best for small websites with a small number of visitors , and also can by used by developers to practice deploying thier own sites
	- some companies offer free shared hosting , with limitations => advertisements in the web page
2. virtual private hosing
	- sites with considerable demands use virtual private surface "VPS"
	- VPS : virtaul server with dedicated cpu , memory , and bandwidth resources 
	- VPS is running on a hardware server with other instances of VPS ( but the resources are fixed per instance => other don't slow you )
	- this option is more expensive than shared hosting
3. dedicated hosting
	- hardware server that is dedicated to you only ( cpu , memory , bandwidth ) are all yours to use
	- this option is more expensive than VPS hosting
4. cloud hosting
	- your web site runs in something called "cloud environment" , which spans across multiple physical and virtual servers
	- if one of the servers failed , your website will run on another and stay online
	- the advantage of cloud hosting is that you can use as many resources as you need without hardware limitations
	- you pay for resource use => pay for the bandwidth used for transferring files
	- this allows websites and web applications to scale thier costs as popularity grows ( this is how many of the major web apps operate )
	- cloud allows you to run your web site on multiple virtual and physical web servers
